	* camel-pop3-folder.c, camel-pop3-summary.c: Changed uid to be
	stamp,uid.  So we can easily strip the time from the cache uid.
	We now store cache items by the real uid, not the uid+time.

	* camel-pop3-folder.c (pop3_sync): honour keep_on_server here.
	(camel_pop3_folder_new): setup the summary here, not init.
	(cmd_buildinfo): set the uid on the messageinfo.
	(cmd_list): assign fi to the allocated object.  Why am i putting
	such detailed changelogs in prototype code ...

	* camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_construct): add a constructor to snarf
	keep_on_server.

	* camel-pop3-summary.c (pop3_message_info_*): Removed the special
	messageinfo stuff, we just use the base class now and store proper
	summary entries.

	* camel-pop3-folder.c, camel-pop3-summary.c: Change the uid format
	to include a timestamp so we can sort properly.
	(pop3_refresh_info): we now downlod either the TOP or the whole
	message here as well, so we can build a full messageinfo properly.
