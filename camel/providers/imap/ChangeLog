	* camel-imap-folder.c:(do_append): Null check the 
	info before using it
	initialize flags as we '&' with old value.

2005-09-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-command.c
	* camel-imap-folder.c: Use g_ascii_str(n)casecmp() instead of
	str(n)casecmp(). The strings we are comparing in these cases
	should be just ASCII anyway, so spell it out that we really do
	need ASCII casefolding only.

	* camel-imap-folder.c
	* camel-imap-search.c
	* camel-imap-store.c: No strtok_r() in Microsoft's C library, but
	strtok() is MT-safe, which is enough for the way it's used in this
	file, to tokenize only one string at a time.

	* camel-imap-store.c (connect_to_server_process,
	connect_to_server_wrapper): Using custom commands to connect to
	IMAP servers is not supported on Win32 (at least for now), so
	bypass that code.

	* camel-imap-wrapper.c: If no ENETUNREACH (Win32), use EINVAL.

	* camel-imap-store-summary.c (camel_imap_store_summary_add_from_full): Check if 
	Inbox only if the Store info is not Null.

	exception before trying more ops.

	around imap connect/command & clear exception for fail-over.

2005-08-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #242032.

	* camel-imap-folder.c (do_append): if append fails with no/bad,
	then retry without custom flags, if we were trying to send them.

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_read_response): return
	SERVICE_INVALID rather than SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE for a BAD/NO
	response.

2005-08-15  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #242032.

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_read_response): tread BAD the same as
	NO.

	* camel-imap-folder.c (do_append): snarf incoming label if it has
	one.  also only try to set flags the server says we can.

	* camel-imap-utils.c (imap_label_to_flags): helper to map label
	tag to imap flags.

	* camel-imap-folder.c (flags_to_label, imap_rescan)
	(imap_update_summary): if we get a server $Label flag, map it to
	the label tag as well.

	* camel-imap-summary.c (label_to_flags, message_info_load)
	(info_set_user_tag, camel_imap_summary_add_offline)
	(camel_imap_summary_add_offline_uncached): map the "label"
	user-tag into an imap server flag.

	* camel-imap-utils.c (imap_create_flag_list)
	(imap_parse_flag_list): store the junk flag as a custom flag Junk,
	and support our own $Labelx flags.  if the server supports custom
	flags.

2005-08-12  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use NO_UNDEFINED. Link with libcamel-provider,
	libcamel and CAMEL_LIBS.

2005-08-09  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #312715 & other little fixes

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_offline): use the store summary
	as the indicator to whether the folder exists or not, not the
	files on disk.

	(rename_folder): same here.
	(imap_forget_folder): remove the subfolders subdir too.

	** See bug #300891
	
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define
	CAMEL_EXPLICIT_TRANSLATION_DOMAIN.

	* camel-imap-provider.c (camel_provider_module_init):
	set translation_domain in CamelProvider struct.

2005-08-09  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	(refresh_refresh): we just refresh all folders, subscribed or not.

	the folder-summary from the server results, and then just get the
	folderinfo from that using get_folder_info_offline.
	(get_folders_sync): renamed from get_folders_online.
	(imap_connect_online): get the root list of folders differently,
	it will explictly check the namespace first.  and just make sure
	inbox is subscribed.
	(imap_is_subfolder, get_subscribed_folders) 
	(get_folders_add_folders, get_folders): removed old stuff.

2005-07-28  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #311731.

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_info_offline): build the
	folderinfo from the search base so we dont over-expand it.

2005-07-27  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_info_online): make sure we get
	subscribed folders using lsub too, if we're getting a list of all
	folders.  See bug #311658.

	* camel-imap-folder.c (imap_sync_online): make sure we're
	connected before issuing a command.

2005-07-21  Shreyas Srinivasan  <sshreyas@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-wrapper.h: Fix camel-docs breakage by changing
	style
	
2005-07-20  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap-store.h: re-arrange some bitfields (this is not
	public api), and add a refresh stamp so we know when to next
	refresh the list of folders from the server.

	* camel-imap-store.c (imap_build_folder_info): set unknown counts
	-1, not 0.
	(get_folder_online): if the folder is on disk, just get it
	offline, only go to the server if we need to.
	(fill_fi): dont refresh the folder here, let the client code do
	it.

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_command_start): add some asserts,
	time to fix those 'stream == NULL' warnings properly.
	(camel_imap_command_continuation): same.

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_counts): remove this, we rely on
	the client calling folder.refresh_info instead.
	(get_one_folder_offline): removed, handled more directly from the
	storesummary now.
	(refresh_refresh): new async function to update the list of
	folders (not the folder counts) from the server.  We now just use
	"*" to get all the folders rather than frobbing around with
	partial fetches.
	(get_folder_info_online): changed radically, if we are getting
	subscribed folders, always go to the local list, but update it
	asynchronously if we need to.  if we're not, then always go to the
	server, but use a simplified listing mechanism.
	(camel_imap_store_connected): changed to hide some hidden logic,
	we want not only connected, but online as well; so make it
	actually do that.
	(fill_fi): dont do anything slow here, dont honour the 'not fast'
	flag anymore.

2005-07-19  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	until we need it.
	(camel_imap_folder_fetch_data): force a connect if we need it.
	(imap_refresh_info): force connect if we need to.
	(imap_get_message): touch the summary if we changed the body
	content info record.

	* camel-imap-store.c (camel_imap_store_init): we always support
	subscriptions, this is a backend property not a store instance
	property.
	(imap_connect_online, rename_folder, get_one_folder_offline) 
	(get_folder_info_offline): fix for above.
	(get_folder_offline): wtf is it connecting for???

2005-03-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_read_untagged): Continue reading data
	until we've read all the data (camel_stream_read() makes no
	guarantee that it will read n bytes in a single call).

2005-03-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-folder.c (imap_sync_online): READ-ONLY doesn't mean
	we can't sync flags, allow flag syncing even in READ-ONLY mode
	since the RFC states that flags listed in PERMANENTFLAGS are
	always settable.

2005-03-07  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	From Dave Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>
	
	* camel-imap-store-summary.c
